<!-- Intro Section -->
<p align="center">
  I am a  <strong>Frontend Engineer</strong>, passionate about building 
  <em>impactful digital experiences, combining all my skills to develop life-changing and groundbreaking software projects. 
  My goal is to fully immerse myself in the AI and digital world while making technology more accessible and effortless for others</em>, 
  and merging these efforts with the power of <strong>Data & AI</strong>.
</p>

<p align="center">
  🌱 I started with <strong>Data and Data Science</strong>, building a foundation in 
  <strong>data analysis and research</strong>.  
  Through research, I discovered how critical it is to not just create models, but to design systems that scale and solve real-world problems.  
  This insight pushed me to expand into <strong>software engineering</strong>, so I can bridge the gap between data models and practical applications.  
  My journey is guided by the belief that <em>research inspires innovation, and engineering brings that innovation to life</em>. <br><br>
  <strong>Frontend + Data + AI = Intelligent, scalable, and transformative products.</strong>
